const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Who is this course for?",
    a: "This programme is designed for actors at all stages who want to strengthen their accent technique, deepen their connection to their voice, and integrate accent work into performance. It's particularly suited to actors preparing for self-tapes, auditions, or roles requiring accent flexibility.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need previous accent training?",
    a: "No. The course is structured to support a range of experience levels. Each module builds clear foundations while offering depth for actors who have trained before.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the course delivered?",
    a: "Sessions are delivered live online in small groups. All sessions are recorded and made available to participants if you're unable to attend live.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes this course different?",
    a: "This programme treats accent work as part of performance — not something separate or \"put on\". Training draws from vocal anatomy, embodied voice work, social and cultural awareness, and practical performance application. Community and shared learning are central to the process.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I take just one module?",
    a: "Yes. You can book one module, two modules, or the full programme. Each module runs for 5 weeks and stands alone, while also connecting to the wider training.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much time should I commit each week?",
    a: "You can expect one live 1.5-hour session per week, plus independent practice between sessions (around 2 hours a week for daily exercises and script preparation). The course is designed to fit around professional and training commitments.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there personalised feedback?",
    a: "Yes. Each participant receives tailored feedback within the group setting, alongside structured exercises to support individual progress, as well as detailed feedback on each module's final submitted self-tape.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a community space for participants?",
    a: "Yes. An optional WhatsApp group will be offered to each cohort as a space to connect with fellow participants, share reflections or resources, and build a sense of community between sessions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer student or early bird pricing?",
    a: "Yes. A limited number of student and early bird places are available for each cohort at a reduced rate. These are offered on a first-come basis and are subject to eligibility. See the Terms & Conditions for details.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the refund policy?",
    a: "Due to limited places and small group sizes, refunds are handled in line with the programme's Terms & Conditions. Full details can be found on the Terms & Conditions page.",

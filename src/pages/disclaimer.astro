        The Accent Training Programme and all associated sessions are educational voice and performance training. They are not therapy, counselling, or medical treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the work may involve personal exploration of voice, identity, and expression, participants remain responsible for their own wellbeing and are encouraged to seek appropriate professional support where needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        No outcomes relating to employment, casting, auditions, or career progression can be guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This training is intended to support skill development, practice, and confidence in voice and accent work within a performance context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participation is voluntary, and you may step back from any exercise if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        By booking, you acknowledge that you are engaging in professional training and not a healthcare or psychological service.

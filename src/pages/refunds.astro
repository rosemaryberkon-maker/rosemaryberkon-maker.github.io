        This policy exists to be fair to both participants and the running of a small group training programme.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you book a place on the Accent Training Programme, you are reserving one of a limited number of spaces. Because preparation and group balance depend on confirmed numbers, refunds follow the structure below.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">Cooling-Off Period</h2>
        <p>You may cancel within 14 days of booking for a full refund, provided the course has not yet started.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">If the course begins within those 14 days and you choose to attend, the cooling-off period ends at the start of the first session.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">Before the Course Begins</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>More than 14 days</strong> before the start date: full refund minus any payment processing fees</li>
          <li><strong>14 days or fewer</strong> before the start date: 50% refund</li>
          <li><strong>7 days or fewer</strong> before the start date: no refund (your place has been held and preparation has been completed)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">After the Course Has Started</h2>
        <p>Once the programme has begun, refunds are not available. This includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
          <li>Missed sessions</li>
          <li>Schedule conflicts</li>
          <li>Work bookings</li>
          <li>Change of personal circumstances</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">Missed Sessions</h2>
        <p>If you cannot attend a session:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
          <li>Recordings will be provided</li>
          <li>Sessions cannot be transferred to another date or programme</li>
          <li>Unused sessions are not refundable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
        <p>In cases of serious illness or emergency, please contact me directly. Partial credit toward a future course may be offered at my discretion.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">If the Course Is Cancelled</h2>
        <p>If I need to cancel or postpone the programme, you will receive either:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
          <li>A full refund, or</li>
          <li>A transfer to a future intake</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        By booking, you agree to this policy and understand that your place in a small group training environment is reserved specifically for you.
